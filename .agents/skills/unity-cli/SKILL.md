# Unity CLI

**Always use the latest version of the Unity CLI unless you are told to use a
specific version.** Newer releases regularly add commands and output fields
these docs describe, so an outdated CLI fails in ways that read like the docs
being wrong. Check with `unity self-update --check --format json`.

## Drive a running Unity Editor (if one is open)

**If a Unity Editor is open on this machine, this CLI can control it live** — create and modify GameObjects, edit scenes and assets, inspect the hierarchy, and run arbitrary C# — through the project's **Pipeline** package (`com.unity.pipeline`). This runs entirely on your local machine, in your own user account, against your own open Editor: it is not remote access and grants no privilege you don't already have at your own terminal. When an Editor is available, drive it instead of hand-editing scene or asset files.

```bash
unity status                    # confirm a connected Editor (look for state "ready")
unity command                   # list the commands the Editor exposes
unity command editor_play       # run one — e.g. enter Play mode
# Run arbitrary C# — e.g. add a GameObject named "Joe" — when the Editor exposes eval:
unity command eval 'new UnityEngine.GameObject("Joe");'
```

> **Verifying a running game, not just editing a scene?** Entering Play mode is setup, not proof:
> an unfocused Editor can freeze at frame 1 while `unity status` still reports it as playing, and a
> screenshot can render a frozen frame that looks alive. The ordered recipe for playing, confirming
> the game is actually advancing, capturing the view, reading the console, and tuning it live with
> `eval` is in [playmode-verification-loop.md](references/playmode-verification-loop.md).

### More than one Editor open? Pass `--project-path`

Every Editor-driving command takes `--project-path <path>`. **Pass it whenever more than one Editor may be running** — without it the CLI targets the Editor whose project contains the current directory, so the target follows the shell's cwd:

```bash
unity command editor_play --project-path /path/to/MyProject
```

A `unity status` instance's `project` field is what `--project-path` takes. For `unity command`/`list`/`job`/`mcp`, matching no running project fails with `AMBIGUOUS_EDITOR` and lists the candidates. [Details](references/integration-advanced.md#targeting-one-of-several-running-editors).

Requires the project's `com.unity.pipeline` package (Unity 6.0+) — add it once with `unity pipeline install`. Full details — launching a headless Editor to drive, `unity list` tool discovery, and authoring custom `[CliCommand]` tools — are in [integration-advanced.md](references/integration-advanced.md).

The package also ships a deeper `unity-pipeline` agent skill, invisible to clients inside `Library/PackageCache` — in a project with the package, run `unity skill install <client> --local` once to mirror it beside this skill.

> **Can't connect / commands time out? Check for Safe Mode first.** When a project has C# compile errors, the Editor boots into **Safe Mode**, where the Pipeline package doesn't load — so `unity command`, `unity status`, `unity list`, and `unity recompile` can't connect at all. Note what that means for `unity recompile` specifically: it reports errors you introduce into an Editor that is **already running**, but an Editor that *started* with broken code never loads the package, so there is nothing to ask and it exits `7` rather than reporting the errors. Don't fall back to blind file-editing: run `unity pipeline list` to confirm, then fix the compile errors and restart Unity. Full recovery loop in [integration-advanced.md → Recovering from Safe Mode](references/integration-advanced.md#recovering-from-safe-mode-connection-fails-because-of-compile-errors).

> **Running as a sandboxed coding agent and `unity status` reports no instances?** A restrictive sandbox can hide an Editor that is genuinely running from this CLI's view of it — don't treat that alone as proof the Editor is down. Full detail in [integration-advanced.md → Sandboxed agent tooling can hide a running Editor](references/integration-advanced.md#sandboxed-agent-tooling-can-hide-a-running-editor).

## Install the CLI (if not already installed)

First check if the CLI is available:

```bash
which unity && unity --version
```

If not found, install it:

**macOS / Linux**
```bash
curl -fsSL https://unity.com/install.sh | bash
```

**Windows (PowerShell)**
```powershell
irm https://unity.com/install.ps1 | iex
```

After installing, open a new shell so `unity` is on PATH, then verify with `unity --version`. If the install script fails or the binary is still not found, tell the user and stop; if the command itself fails with a permissions error or crash, the installation may be broken — suggest re-running the install script.

## Global flags

These work on every command:

| Flag | Description |
|---|---|
| `--format <fmt>` | Output format: `human` (default), `json`, `tsv`, `ndjson`, `github`. Also via `UNITY_FORMAT` env var. |
| `--json` | Global shorthand for `--format json`, accepted on every command (e.g. `unity status --json`, `unity doctor --json`). `--format` takes precedence when both are supplied. |
| `--no-banner` | Suppress the branded header — use in scripts |
| `--no-pager` | Turn off paging. Governs both pagers: the external one over the long listings (`unity command`, `releases`, `editors`, `changelog`, `logs`) and the interactive one in `unity projects list`. Also via `UNITY_NO_PAGER` (presence-based — any value, including `0`, disables it). |
| `--non-interactive` | Disable all interactive prompts — use in CI |
| `--quiet` | Suppress non-essential output |
| `--verbose` | Print full error details (stack trace + cause chain) on failure. Also via `UNITY_VERBOSE`. |
| `--proxy <url>` | HTTP/HTTPS/SOCKS/PAC proxy URL for this invocation. Also via `UNITY_PROXY`. Takes precedence over standard `HTTPS_PROXY`/`HTTP_PROXY`/`ALL_PROXY` env vars and the persisted `proxy.json` setting. |
| `--proxy-disable` | Disable proxy for this invocation, ignoring all sources (env vars, persisted config, system settings). |
| `--log-proxy` | Log one redacted entry per outbound request to `proxy-request.json` — for reproducing proxy issues. Also via `UNITY_LOG_PROXY=1` or the `proxyRequestLogging` setting. |
| `--no-log-proxy` | Opt a single invocation out of proxy request logging when it's enabled globally. |
| `--color <auto\|always\|never>` | Control colored output for this invocation, overriding `NO_COLOR`/`FORCE_COLOR` and TTY auto-detection. Governs every ANSI-emitting surface (help, tables, spinners, errors), not just `human` output. |
| `--no-color` | Shorthand for `--color never`. Whichever of `--color`/`--no-color` appears last on the line wins. |

**Always use `--format json` when you need to parse output programmatically.**

`--accelerator <host:port>` and `--no-accelerator` are **not** root globals — they are accepted only on `run`, `test` and `build`, and only after the command name. See [build-run-test.md](references/build-run-test.md).

**`unity projects list` is the only command that pages IN-PROCESS.** It shows 10 projects per screen and waits for a keypress between screens, and only when stdout is a terminal. Paging is off for redirected stdout, under `--format json` and `--format ndjson`, and under `--all`, `--watch`, or `--no-pager` / `UNITY_NO_PAGER`.

**Not every machine format bypasses that one.** Only `json` and `ndjson` get their own non-interactive rendering; on a terminal, `--format tsv` and `--format github` fall through to the human table and page like `human` does — so `--format tsv` on a TTY yields neither TSV nor unpaged output. Redirect stdout (the usual case for a machine format) or pass `--no-pager`. Note this is the **opposite** of the external pager below, which is `human`-only: the two mechanisms differ here, and `projects list` is the surprising one.

**The long listings page through an external pager, like `git log`.** `unity command` (the bare listing), `unity releases`, `unity editors`, `unity changelog`, and `unity logs` pipe human output through `less -RFX` on a terminal — colors kept, no screen clear, and `-F` quits by itself when the output already fits one screen, so short listings show no pager UI. `$UNITY_PAGER` then `$PAGER` override the choice and run through a shell, so `PAGER="less -S"` works; a blank value is ignored rather than treated as an opt-out. Quitting with `q` exits cleanly with the command's own exit code. Unlike `projects list`'s pager this one is **`human`-only**, and it never engages for redirected stdout, any machine format (`json`, `tsv`, `ndjson`, `github`), `--quiet`, `TERM=dumb`, the streaming modes (`editors --watch`, `logs --follow`), a named `unity command <name>`, or inside `unity shell`. A broken pager costs the paging, not the output: a `$PAGER` naming something that is not there is resolved before anything spawns, and one that spawns and then dies has its output reprinted to the terminal, decided from the pager's exit status (a clean exit is a normal `q` and discards; a failure status reprints). The exception is a pager that exits *successfully* without reading — `PAGER=true`, or anything that lingers and then exits 0 — which nothing distinguishes from a `q`, and which `git` loses too. A pager that starts and merely *waits* is not treated as broken, so the CLI waits with it.

A branded Unity header (logo, wordmark, CLI version) renders on the landing surfaces — bare `unity`, `unity --help` / `-h`, `unity help`, and above the first-run consent prompt. It's shown only on a TTY, prints at most once, and degrades to compact, uncolored text on narrow terminals, without Unicode, or under `NO_COLOR`. Piped output is unaffected. Use `--no-banner` to suppress it in scripts. Bare `unity` prints usage and exits 0.

## Environment variables

All CLI env vars use the `UNITY_` prefix. A CLI flag always overrides the corresponding env var.

| Variable | Mirrors flag | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `UNITY_FORMAT` | `--format` | Output format (`human`, `json`, `tsv`, `ndjson`, `github`). `HUB_FORMAT` is a deprecated alias. |
| `UNITY_EDITOR_VERSION` | `--editor-version` | Editor version (e.g. `2023.3.0f1`, `latest`, `lts`). |
| `UNITY_ARCHITECTURE` | `--architecture` | Chip architecture (`x86_64`, `arm64`). |
| `UNITY_PROJECT_PATH` | path argument | Project path — used by `open`, and also honored by `status` and the cloud commands. |
| `UNITY_QUIET` | `--quiet` | Suppress non-essential output. |
| `UNITY_VERBOSE` | `--verbose` | Show full error details on failure. |
| `UNITY_NON_INTERACTIVE` | `--non-interactive` | Disable interactive prompts. |
| `UNITY_NO_BANNER` | `--no-banner` | Suppress the branded banner. |
| `UNITY_NO_PAGER` | `--no-pager` | Turn off paging — both the external pager over the long listings and `unity projects list`'s interactive one. Presence-based: any value counts, including `0`. |
| `UNITY_PAGER` | — | The pager to use for the long listings, overriding `$PAGER` and the `less -RFX` default. Runs through a shell, so flags work (`less -S`). A blank value is ignored, not an opt-out. |
| `PAGER` | — | Same as `UNITY_PAGER`, consulted only when that is unset or blank. |
| `LESS` / `LV` / `LESSCHARSET` / `MORE` | — | Passed to the pager only when you have not set them, defaulting to `FRX`, `-c`, `utf-8`, and `FRX`. `LESSCHARSET` keeps multi-byte glyphs readable where the locale does not declare UTF-8; `MORE` exists because `more` on macOS/BSD is `less` under another name and reads `$MORE`, so without it `PAGER=more` waits for a keypress even for one line. |
| `UNITY_RUN_TIMEOUT` | `--timeout` | Timeout for `unity run` in seconds. |
| `UNITY_TEST_TIMEOUT` | `--timeout` | Timeout for `unity test` in seconds. |
| `UNITY_CLOUD_ORG` | `--cloud-org` | Active Unity Cloud organization id or name for a single call. |
| `UNITY_CLOUD_PROJECT` | `--cloud-project` | Cloud project ID; used by Cloud Build inventory. Pipeline Automation inventory is organization-scoped. |
| `UNITY_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_ID` | — | Service account client ID for non-interactive (CI) auth. |
| `UNITY_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_SECRET` | — | Service account client secret for non-interactive (CI) auth. |
| `UNITY_PROXY` | `--proxy` | HTTP/HTTPS/SOCKS/PAC proxy URL. Takes precedence over `HTTPS_PROXY`/`HTTP_PROXY`/`ALL_PROXY` and the persisted `proxy.json` setting. |
| `UNITY_NO_UPDATE_CHECK` | — | Disable the background "update available" check (see `unity config update-check`). |
| `UNITY_NO_CONSENT_PROMPT` | — | Suppress the one-time first-run analytics consent prompt *without* recording a choice — for wrapper scripts on an interactive terminal that must never absorb the prompt. Analytics stay off until you run `unity analytics opt-in`. Unlike `UNITY_NON_INTERACTIVE`, it changes nothing else about command behavior. |
| `UNITY_NO_CRASH_REPORT` | — | Disable anonymous crash/error reporting (Sentry) entirely. |
| `UNITY_LOG_PROXY` | `--log-proxy` | Log one redacted entry per outbound request to `proxy-request.json`. Truthy values: `1`, `true`. |
| `UNITY_ACCELERATOR` | `--accelerator` | Unity Accelerator endpoint (`host:port`). Outranks the persisted `accelerator.json`; `--accelerator` outranks it. |
| `UNITY_NO_ELEVATE` | `--no-elevate` | Windows: skip the elevated (UAC) install helper for `install` / `install-modules`, so the install service runs unelevated. The Editor's NSIS installer still asks for elevation on demand if Windows requires it for your account — an administrator token always does; a standard user never does. |
| `UNITY_INSTALL_RETRIES` | `--retries` (`install-modules` only) | Number of times `install` and `install-modules` retry an editor or module download whose transfer or validation fails. `0` disables retries; `unity install` has no `--retries` flag, so set the variable there. |
| `UNITY_NO_AUTH_BROKER` | — | Skip the resident auth broker and read credentials directly from the OS keyring. By default every command that needs a token goes through a broker that starts on demand and exits after two idle minutes (see [auth-license-cloud.md](references/auth-license-cloud.md)). |
| `UNITY_PEER_AUTH_MODE` | — | How the auth broker and the Editor identity helper verify a connecting process’s code signature. `enforce` is the default on macOS and Windows: an unsigned or non-Unity-signed peer is refused. `identify-only` logs without refusing — use it for an Editor you built from source. Linux logs only unless set to `enforce` together with `UNITY_PEER_AUTH_LINUX_ALLOWED_HASHES` (comma-separated SHA-256 hashes of trusted executables). |
| `UNITY_CLI_HOME` | — | Install root for the install script and `unity self-install`, on every platform including Windows: the binary lands in `<UNITY_CLI_HOME>/bin` instead of the default location. |
| `UNITY_CLI_FTUE` | — | Agent first-session ("paved") mode. Any value except empty or `0` turns it on. Every `--format json` envelope and ndjson `result` frame then carries a top-level `"paved": true`, and `projects create` saves the choice to the new project's `UserSettings/UnityCliPaved.json`, so later commands run in that project are paved with no variable set. Nothing else changes. See [projects-templates.md](references/projects-templates.md). |
| `UNITY_NO_EDITOR_IDENTITY_SERVER` | — | Disable the background identity helper that `unity open` starts to answer the Editor’s sign-in lookups when no Hub is running (see [projects-templates.md](references/projects-templates.md)). Presence-based. |
| `UNITY_EXPERIMENTAL_FEX_EMU` | none | Linux arm64 only, experimental and unsupported: run the x86_64 Editor under FEX-Emu. `1`, `true` or `yes` turns it on, and it takes effect only when FEX-Emu and an x86_64 RootFS are installed (`unity doctor` checks). C# script compilation is known to crash under FEX-Emu. See [editors-install.md](references/editors-install.md). |

**CI service account auth:** Set both `UNITY_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_ID` and `UNITY_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_SECRET` to skip the browser OAuth flow — this keeps the secret out of the process argument list and shell history. These map to the `--client-id` / `--secret-from-stdin` inputs of `unity auth login`, but reading the credentials from the environment isn't a full login: it doesn't run the interactive flow or persist credentials to the keyring.

## Getting help

Append `-h` or `--help` to any command or subcommand, at any level: `unity --help`, `unity projects create --help`.

**Not sure which command does something? Search before you guess a name.** `unity commands --grep <pattern>` matches command names, descriptions, and options, plus the plugin catalog, installed or not:

```bash
unity commands --grep license                 # one match per line
unity commands --grep 'build|test' --format json
```

Each result says whether it is a `command` or a `plugin`. A plugin that isn't installed also names its install command (`unity plugin install <id>`). Matching is case-insensitive, and the pattern is a regular expression evaluated with a timeout, so a plain keyword works as-is. See [integration-advanced.md](references/integration-advanced.md) for the output fields.

## Exit codes

| Code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| 0 | Success |
| 1 | General error |
| 2 | Bad arguments |
| 3 | Authentication failure |
| 4 | Precondition not met (e.g. no license active, floating server not configured) |
| 6 | Command-specific failure |
| 7 | Network or transient service failure for cloud automation inventory (see its reference for exact mappings). |
| 8 | `unity test` only — the tests ran and one or more **failed**. Every other way a test run fails (compile error, unavailable license, editor crash, `--timeout`) keeps `6`, so CI can retry an infrastructure failure and never retry a failing test. |
| 9 | `unity install`, `unity install-modules` and `unity projects require` only: `--no-wait` or `--wait-timeout` ran out while the Hub or another CLI held the shared install lock (`INSTALL_LOCK_BUSY`). Retry later. Earlier items of the same run may already be installed; see `data.completedUids`. |
| 130 | Interrupted — Ctrl+C / SIGINT (128 + 2) |
| 143 | Terminated by SIGTERM (128 + 15) — e.g. `kill` or a CI/runner timeout. Emitted by long-running commands that install a signal handler to clean up first (currently `unity build`, which scrubs the temporary Android keystore). |

The `cloud` and `auth` commands map an authentication failure (expired/missing session, rejected sign-in) to `3`, and any other operational failure (network, server error) to `6` — so scripts can reliably tell "sign in again" apart from a genuine command failure.

## Common workflows

### Inspect cloud builds or Pipeline Automation resources

Read [cloud-automation.md](references/cloud-automation.md) for every read-only
command in both groups, context/authentication, per-command filters and sorting,
output fields, pagination (including the leaves that refuse `--page`/`--limit`
rather than ignoring them), errors, and redaction. `pipeline cloud-build` reads Build Automation;
`pipeline automation` reads Pipeline Automation. Neither needs a running Editor
or the local Pipeline package. Use numeric organization IDs for service accounts.
These commands don't trigger builds/jobs, fetch logs/artifacts, or change
configuration.

JSON/NDJSON return full API-shaped results under `data`, as Collab does; NDJSON
has one terminal result, without item frames. Preserve native fields and free-form
metadata, subject to the reference's bounded secret protections and public-API
redaction assumption. Table projections remain separate. Explicit local build
targets retain `_local`; missing targets aren't local. These conventions apply
to follow-up cloud-automation work too.

### Edit a scene, GameObject, or asset — `unity status` first

**Before editing any scene, GameObject, prefab, or asset, run `unity status` to detect a connected Editor.** If one is reachable, drive it with live commands instead of touching project files — the Editor applies changes to the *actual active scene* and keeps its in-memory state in sync.

```bash
unity status                       # is an Editor connected? (look for state "ready")
unity command                      # discover the scene/GameObject commands THIS Editor exposes
# then drive it with the commands it lists — for example, if your Editor exposes them:
unity command create_gameobject    # act on the live, active scene
unity command save_scene           # persist the active scene
```

Command names are defined by the Editor, so run `unity command` (or `unity list`) to see the exact set — don't assume a name.

> **Never hand-edit `.unity`, `.prefab`, or `.asset` YAML while a live Editor is reachable.** Raw-file edits are:
> - **error-prone** — fileIDs and GUIDs are assigned by hand and easy to get wrong;
> - **invisible** to the running Editor until a reimport, so the change silently fails to take effect; and
> - **prone to hitting the wrong file** — e.g. writing to `SampleScene.unity` while the Editor's active scene is actually `Demo2.unity`, producing valid-looking YAML that changes nothing the user sees.

**Rule out two false negatives before concluding no Editor is reachable — both look identical to a genuinely closed Editor, and both are easy to get wrong under time pressure:**

- **Safe Mode.** If an Editor *is* running for this project but `unity status` / `unity command` won't connect, it may be stuck in **Safe Mode** from a compile error rather than genuinely absent. Run `unity pipeline list` — if it reports Safe Mode, editing the C# source to fix the compile errors (and then restarting Unity) *is* the correct move, not a fallback. See [integration-advanced.md → Recovering from Safe Mode](references/integration-advanced.md#recovering-from-safe-mode-connection-fails-because-of-compile-errors).
- **A sandboxed agent shell.** If your own shell commands run inside a restrictive sandbox — the normal case for a coding agent like this one — the sandbox can hide a genuinely running Editor from `unity status` the same way. This applies to **every** scene/GameObject/prefab/asset task that reaches this preflight, not only ones that obviously need a live Editor: a task you could otherwise finish without any CLI involvement (e.g. generating an asset through ordinary Editor APIs) can still get funneled into "no Editor" here and derailed. Don't treat "no instances" as proof the Editor is down, and don't quietly improvise a third path — like driving a separate headless Editor process to approximate what a live connection would have done — as a substitute for a disclosed file edit. Say plainly that your sandbox may be blocking your view of a real Editor, and ask whether one is actually open before falling back. Full detail: [integration-advanced.md → Sandboxed agent tooling can hide a running Editor](references/integration-advanced.md#sandboxed-agent-tooling-can-hide-a-running-editor).

Only fall back to editing files directly once you've ruled out both of the above — and say so explicitly ("no live Editor detected, editing the file directly").

### Generate an asset, texture, sprite, image, or 3D model: check for the `ai` catalog plugin

**Before approximating a "generate a texture/sprite/image/3D model for my project" request some
other way, check whether the Unity AI Generators plugin (`ai`) is installed.** It is Unity's own
catalog plugin for exactly this class of request, and using it is almost always the better answer.
The same three-step pattern below (recognize the intent, check the catalog, ask before installing)
applies to any catalog plugin the CLI ships, not only this one; `unity plugin list` always
reflects the full catalog, installed or not, so it is how you discover what else is available too.

1. **Check whether it's installed.**
   ```bash
   unity plugin list --format json
   ```
   Find the entry whose `id` is `"ai"` and read its `installed` field (`true` / `false`).

2. **Not installed? Tell the user, then ask, never install silently.** Say plainly that Unity
   ships an AI Generators plugin that covers this, and wait for a yes before running:
   ```bash
   unity plugin install ai
   ```
   A refusal is a normal answer: fall back to whatever you would otherwise have done, and don't
   ask again in the same conversation.

   `ai` is alpha, and during alpha it's gated to Unity staff on Unity's internal network. An
   ordinary user's `unity plugin install ai` can fail with a **sign-in** message ("Unity AI
   Generators is currently limited to Unity staff. Sign in with a Unity staff account…") or, once
   past that, a plain **download failure** if the network it needs isn't reachable from where
   you're running. Neither is a bug in the request: report the message and fall back, the same as
   any other refusal.

3. **Pick up its agent skill in the same session.** A catalog plugin can ship its own agent skill
   inside its payload (`ai` does), and installing the plugin does not, by itself, make that skill
   visible to you; it has to be mirrored the same way this skill itself is:
   ```bash
   unity skill install <client>     # e.g. claude-code, first time this session
   unity skill refresh              # already mirrored earlier? re-render it fresh
   ```
   `unity plugin install`'s own last line already tells you which one applies: it points at
   `unity skill install` right after installing a copy that ships a skill, and at
   `unity skill refresh` once one is already mirrored but the plugin's copy just changed. Confirm
   where it landed with `unity skill list --format json` (look for the row whose `skill` field
   names the plugin's own skill, e.g. `unity-ai`, and read its `path`), then read that file before
   driving the plugin's commands. Don't guess its command surface from this skill, which only
   documents `unity` itself.

**A command invoked before any of this** (`unity ai …` typed straight, or suggested from memory)
**fails with a clear, actionable message** naming the exact install command (`unity plugin install
ai`), in both human and machine (`--format json` / `--format ndjson`) output, under the stable
error code `TOOL_NOT_INSTALLED`. Read that message rather than guessing why the command did
nothing; the same shape (`TOOL_UNSUPPORTED_PLATFORM`, `TOOL_RUNTIME_NOT_INSTALLED`) covers the
two other reasons a catalog tool can't run.

### Bootstrap a new project from scratch

Take an idea to a running, version-controlled project using only the CLI. Decide the **target
platforms first** — they determine which Editor modules you install in step 2. You can add
modules later (`unity install-modules`), but a project can't build for a platform until that
platform's module is installed, so it's simplest to decide up front.

```bash
# 1. Confirm the CLI works and you're signed in and licensed (see references/auth-license-cloud.md).
unity --version
unity auth status --format json      # if signed out:      unity auth login
unity license status --format json   # if none active:      unity license activate

# 2. Pick and install an Editor with the modules your target platforms need.
#    Default to the latest LTS (most stable, ~2 years of patches). Reach for a Tech-stream
#    release (--stream tech) only for a feature not yet in LTS; treat --stream beta/alpha as
#    evaluation-only, never for a project you intend to ship. A deadline argues for LTS.
#    (lts / latest aliases work almost everywhere a version is accepted — `templates` is the
#     exception; see step 3.)
unity releases --stream lts --limit 5 --format json
unity install lts --module android --module ios --yes --accept-eula   # add --module webgl, etc.
unity editors --installed --format json                               # confirm it landed

# 3. List the real template ids this Editor offers — don't guess them — and pick by RENDER
#    PIPELINE, not just by 2D/3D. Default to the URP templates:
#      3D → com.unity.template.urp-blank      ("Universal 3D")
#      2D → com.unity.template.universal-2d   ("Universal 2D": URP + the 2D packages)
#    com.unity.template.3d and com.unity.template.2d are the Built-in Render Pipeline templates
#    (displayName "… (Built-In Render Pipeline)"): deprecated from Unity 6.5, gone in 6.7. Use
#    them only when the user explicitly asks for Built-in. Confirm the pick with the JSON
#    `renderPipeline` field — it is blank for universal-2d on current releases, so match that
#    one by id.
#    NOTE: `templates` does NOT resolve the lts / latest aliases — unlike `install` and
#    `projects create`, it passes --editor straight through and rejects anything that is not a
#    concrete 6000.x.y. Use the version you just installed (read it from `editors --installed`).
unity templates list --editor <6000.x.y> --type core --format json

# 4. Create the project. The first positional arg is the NAME; --path sets the parent directory.
#    All options supplied, so it won't prompt; add --non-interactive in CI.
#    (To publish it to a remote in the same step, use the source-control forms below instead.)
unity projects create "MyGame" --path ~/UnityProjects \
  --editor-version lts --template com.unity.template.urp-blank

# 5. Add the Pipeline package BEFORE the first open. `unity command`, `unity status` and
#    `unity command eval` all need it, and templates don't include it. The Editor reads
#    Packages/manifest.json when it loads the project, so installing first means the package
#    is live from the first open.
unity pipeline install --project-path ~/UnityProjects/MyGame

# 6. Open the project and wait until its Editor is ready to take commands. Run from inside the
#    project so the CLI targets its Editor (--project-path here is a substring filter, not a path).
cd ~/UnityProjects/MyGame
unity open .
unity status --until-ready --project-path MyGame --format json
```

**Then build the scene in the live Editor, not in batch mode.** Create GameObjects, wire
components, and set asset references with `unity command eval` (or the Editor's own `unity command`
tools) against the running Editor, and read the result back the same way. Each step can be
checked before the next one. A script run through `unity run -- -executeMethod` is the
**fallback** for when no Editor can stay open (CI, a headless build box). It can't see what it
produced: a reference saved as null, such as a `UIDocument` with no `PanelSettings`, still
reports success. If you do use batch mode, open the result in a live Editor and inspect it before
calling the work done. How to get an Editor to drive:
[integration-advanced.md → Getting an Editor to drive](references/integration-advanced.md#getting-an-editor-to-drive).

**Source control — let the user choose.** The CLI publishes the new project to a fresh remote in
one step for any provider. **Always pass tokens on stdin** (`--git-token-stdin`) so secrets never
land in shell history or the process list. Pick based on the project — don't default to one:

- **Git — GitHub / GitLab** (`--vcs github` / `--vcs gitlab`). Ubiquitous. For asset-heavy games
  add **Git LFS** (`--git-lfs`) so large binaries don't bloat history.
- **Unity Version Control — UVCS** (`--vcs uvcs`). Unity's own VCS, built for large binary game
  assets: it handles them natively (**no LFS needed**) and supports file locking — often the
  better fit for art-heavy projects or larger teams. Auth uses your Unity sign-in; `--vcs-region`
  selects the region.

```bash
# Git (GitHub) — drop --git-lfs if the game isn't asset-heavy. Add --no-initial-commit if you
# want to add packages/assets BEFORE the first commit (see the new-unity-project flow).
unity projects create "MyGame" --path ~/UnityProjects \
  --editor-version lts --template com.unity.template.urp-blank \
  --vcs github --git-namespace my-org --git-repo my-game \
  --git-visibility private --git-default-branch main --git-token-stdin --git-lfs

# Unity Version Control (UVCS) — handles binaries natively, so no LFS:
unity projects create "MyGame" --path ~/UnityProjects \
  --editor-version lts --template com.unity.template.urp-blank \
  --vcs uvcs --git-namespace my-org --git-repo my-game --vcs-region <region>
```

Feed the token to `--git-token-stdin` from a secret store, never a literal — e.g.
`… --git-token-stdin <<<"$GIT_TOKEN"` where `$GIT_TOKEN` comes from your CI/secret manager
(UVCS uses your Unity sign-in, so no token is needed).

**Working with a UVCS workspace day to day: a few wrapped reads, everything else straight through
to `cm`.** The split is deliberate and worth teaching, because guessing wrong wastes a user's time:

- **`unity vcs uvcs <verb>`** wraps the reads that **join `cm`'s data to your project** —
  `locks` (who holds a lock, *and which locks cover files you have already changed*),
  `changesets`, and `review`. Those joins are the thing `cm` cannot do for you, and they come in a
  stable envelope, so prefer them whenever something *parses* the output.
- **`unity uvcs <args>`** forwards the whole command line to `cm` verbatim, `--help` and
  `--format` included. That is the supported route, not a workaround: `cm` owns and versions this
  vocabulary, so wrapping it would pin a paraphrase that goes stale. Reach for it for **partial
  checkout**, **shelves**, and **taking or releasing a lock**, and when a human reads the output.

```bash
unity vcs uvcs locks                       # who holds what, and what collides with your changes
unity uvcs lock list                       # the raw listing, cm's own flags and output
unity uvcs partial update /Assets/Levels   # cm's own vocabulary, unchanged
unity uvcs shelve -c "wip: lighting pass"
```

Every verb, flag and trap: [version-control.md](references/version-control.md).

`unity cm <args>` is the same passthrough under cm's own name. Both need the `cm` client; install
it with `unity plugin install plastic` if a command says it is missing.

**Beyond setup, the `vcs` group covers the whole day-2 loop** — `status`, `sync`, `switch`,
`merge-setup`, `conflicts` / `explain` / `resolve`, `diff`, `blame`, `summarize`, `affected`,
`hooks`, `doctor`, `providers` — and the Unity semantics are the reason to reach for it over raw
`git`. Full reference, with the flags and the traps:
[version-control.md](references/version-control.md).

**Git tokens belong to the user's credential manager, not the CLI.** When no token flag or env var
is given, the CLI asks `git credential fill` and uses whatever the configured helper returns; it
stores nothing it is passed or told. Don't suggest the CLI can save a Git token, and don't reach for
a token flag when the user already has a working credential helper. If they want a different token
per organization, that is `git config --global credential.useHttpPath true` plus a multi-account
helper such as [Git Credential Manager](https://github.com/git-ecosystem/git-credential-manager).
The CLI passes the full repo URL so the helper can discriminate, but it never installs or
reconfigures a helper. `UNITY_GITHUB_TOKEN` / `UNITY_GITLAB_TOKEN` are one token per provider, so a
CI job spanning several orgs should pass `--git-token-stdin` per invocation instead. See
[references/projects-templates.md](references/projects-templates.md) for the full
source-control flag set. For a purely local Git repository instead, initialize git with a
Unity-appropriate ignore so the multi-GB `Library/` and other generated folders are never committed:

```bash
cd ~/UnityProjects/MyGame
git init -b main
# Download (do not pipe to a shell) a maintained Unity .gitignore:
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/github/gitignore/main/Unity.gitignore -o .gitignore

# Asset-heavy game? Keep large binaries out of git history with Git LFS:
git lfs install
git lfs track "*.psd" "*.fbx" "*.wav" "*.mp3" "*.png"   # adjust to your asset types
git add .gitattributes

git add -A
git status                             # sanity-check: Library/ Temp/ obj/ Build/ must NOT be staged
git commit -m "Initial Unity project: MyGame"
git ls-files | grep -c '^Library/'     # must print 0
```

**What the CLI does and doesn't cover.** The CLI handles editor, project, and source control.
It does **not** manage UPM (Unity Package Manager) packages — to add packages beyond the
template headlessly, use the **`unity-package-management`** skill (C# PackageManager Client
API). For monetization/backend, hand off to the dedicated skills: `implement-in-app-purchases`
(IAP), `levelplay-unity-integration` (ads), or `build-live-game` (accounts, cloud save,
economy, remote config, leaderboards). Once steps 5 and 6 above are done, work in the open
Editor.

**Installed the Pipeline package while the Editor was already open?** The Editor picks up the
manifest change only when it next refreshes. Until then `unity status` reports
`STATUS_PIPELINE_LOAD_PENDING` (or `STATUS_NO_INSTANCES` on CLI releases before that code
existed). An Editor that is still opening or importing reports the same code until it finishes,
so wait for that first (`unity status --until-ready`). The CLI can't trigger the refresh itself:
if the Editor has finished opening, ask the user to switch to the Unity Editor window, then
re-run `unity status --until-ready`. Installing before the first open (step 5) avoids this
entirely.

### Find and install a missing editor

```bash
# 1. Check what's installed
unity editors --installed --format json

# 2. Browse available LTS versions
unity releases --lts --limit 5 --format json

# 3. Install
unity install 6000.0.47f1 --yes --accept-eula
```

### Open a project with the correct editor

```bash
# 1. Check the project's required editor version
unity projects info /path/to/MyProject --format json
# Look at "editorVersion" in the result

# 2. Confirm that editor is installed
unity editors --installed --format json

# 3. Open (warns if the editor version is missing)
unity open /path/to/MyProject
```

### CI: activate a license, then build

```bash
# 1. Sign in non-interactively with a service account
unity auth login --client-id "$UNITY_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_ID" --secret-from-stdin <<<"$UNITY_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_SECRET"

# 2. Activate the entitlement license (or use --serial / --floating)
unity license activate

# 3. Build
unity build /path/to/MyProject \
  --editor-version 6000.0.47f1 \
  --target StandaloneLinux64 \
  --execute-method Builder.PerformBuild \
  --allow-install
echo "Exit code: $?"

# 4. Return the seat when done (floating/assigned)
unity license return --yes
```

### CI: headless build

Prefer the dedicated `unity build` command (handles batch mode, logging, and CI flags):

```bash
unity build /path/to/MyProject \
  --editor-version 6000.0.47f1 \
  --target StandaloneLinux64 \
  --execute-method Builder.PerformBuild \
  --allow-install
echo "Exit code: $?"
```

Or use `unity run` (batch mode is automatic — never pass `-batchmode`/`-quit`):

```bash
unity run /path/to/MyProject \
  --editor-version 6000.0.47f1 \
  --allow-install \
  -- -executeMethod Builder.PerformBuild -logFile build.log
echo "Exit code: $?"
```

### CI: run tests and publish results

```bash
unity test /path/to/MyProject \
  --editor-version 6000.0.47f1 \
  --mode EditMode \
  --report-format junit \
  --output ./test-results.xml \
  --allow-install \
  --timeout 600
case $? in
  0) echo "All tests passed" ;;
  8) echo "Tests failed — report to developers, do not retry" ;;
  *) echo "Run did not complete — infrastructure failure, safe to retry" ;;
esac
```

Exit `8` means the run finished and reported failing tests; any other non-zero code means it never produced a verdict. Under `--format json` the same split is `errors[0].code`: `TESTS_FAILED` versus `TEST_RUN_ERROR` / `TEST_TIMED_OUT`.

`--report-format junit` makes `--output` a JUnit-schema report, which GitHub Actions and GitLab ingest as native test results with no converter step. It is written even when tests fail. Drop the flag for the NUnit3 default, or use `--report-format nunit,junit` to get both from one run. Add `--coverage` to collect coverage via the Unity Code Coverage package — it warns and carries on if the project doesn't have the package. See [build-run-test.md](references/build-run-test.md).

### Debug the CLI

```bash
# Check auth + installed editors + recent errors in one command
unity doctor --format json

# Follow live logs during an install
unity logs --follow --level info
```

## Notifications

A `--format json` or `--format ndjson` envelope may carry a `notifications`
array: advisories about the user's environment rather than about the command
you ran. **When one is present, tell the user** — they have no other way to see
it, because the human-facing equivalent is a terminal banner that never reaches
you.

The key is absent when there is nothing to report, so read it as
`envelope.notifications ?? []`.

```jsonc
{
  "code": "CLI_UPDATE_AVAILABLE",
  "message": "A new version of the Unity CLI is available: 1.0.0-beta.8 → 1.0.0-beta.9",
  "data": { "current": "1.0.0-beta.8", "latest": "1.0.0-beta.9" },
  "remediation": { "command": "unity self-update", "requiresUserApproval": true }
}
```

Branch on `code`; `message` is localized and meant for display. `data` is
shaped per `code`.

`remediation` says how the notification gets resolved. It may be absent, which
means the notification is informational and there is nothing to run.

`FEX_EMU_EXPERIMENTAL` means the command ran, or will run, the x86_64 Editor
through FEX-Emu on Linux arm64. Tell the user it is experimental and
unsupported and that C# script compilation is known to crash there.

**`requiresUserApproval: true` means do not run `remediation.command`
yourself.** Surface the notification and the command, and let the user decide.

## Notes

- `--non-interactive` and `--yes` together suppress all prompts — use both in CI.
- `--format json` always produces machine-readable output; prefer it over parsing human text. Error envelopes are pretty-printed with the same 2-space indent as success envelopes.
- **Read failures from stdout, not stderr.** A failed command still writes a complete document to stdout: under `--format json` an envelope with `success: false` and a populated `errors` array (`errors[0].code` is the stable token to branch on); under `--format ndjson` the usual terminal `{"type":"result","success":false,…}` frame. **Every ndjson stream ends with exactly one terminal `{"type":"result"}` frame, on success too**, so a stream without one was truncated. Table-shaped listings (`unity editors`, `unity editors upgrade --check`, `unity templates list`, `unity releases`, `unity projects list`, `unity context list`, `unity auth list`, `unity modules list`, `unity list`, `unity doctor`) write one row per line first, with no `type` field on the rows, then a terminal frame whose `data` is `{"count": N}`; `--quiet` drops the rows but keeps the frame (except `unity projects list`, which never quiet-gates its rows), and a `--watch` listing, which only ends on Ctrl-C, writes no terminal frame. A few commands (`unity env`, `unity version`, `unity pipeline list`, `unity install-modules --list`, `unity changelog` among them) still end a successful ndjson stream without one, which is a known bug. **Branch on `success`, never on `data`** — `data` is usually `null` on a failure, but not always: a partial `unity editors add` failure carries a row per path, and an ambiguous `unity auth switch` carries `data.candidates` for you to disambiguate with. Check `success` and the exit code — never treat empty stdout as a failure signal, and do not parse stderr, which carries only human diagnostics in these formats. A handful of commands have not migrated yet and still print `{"error": "…"}` to stderr with empty stdout; if stdout is empty on a non-zero exit, that is a known bug in that command rather than a shape you should code against.
- `unity <version> [path]` is a shorthand for `unity open [path] --editor-version <version>`. Works with `lts`, `latest`, or a full version string like `6000.0.47f1`.
- The CLI supports kubectl-style plugins: any `unity-<name>` binary on PATH is callable as `unity <name>`.
- Terminal output is hardened against control-character / escape-sequence injection from server-provided values (project titles, editor versions, module names) — C0 controls and non-SGR escape sequences are stripped from table/list/tree output, and now also from Commander usage errors, the `unity bug` log-archive warning, and `unity projects add`/`remove` machine (tsv) output, while SGR color/style codes are preserved.
- The CLI reports anonymous crashes and errors via Sentry to help fix bugs (no IP address or hostname; home-directory paths and token-like values scrubbed before send), aligned with the Unity Hub. Opting in to analytics additionally attaches an anonymized machine id; opted-out users stay fully anonymous. Set `UNITY_NO_CRASH_REPORT` to disable reporting entirely. Separately again, every run sends one anonymous `cli telemetry` usage ping regardless of analytics/consent state — see [diagnostics-maintenance.md](references/diagnostics-maintenance.md#analytics--usagetelemetry-consent).
- The CLI is currently in **beta** (latest: `1.0.0-beta.11`). It moved to 1.0 versioning at `1.0.0-beta.1`; it's still a beta. The install command needs no channel setting: until GA ships it installs the latest beta, and afterward the stable release.
- **Always use the latest version of the Unity CLI unless you are told to use a specific version.** A newer CLI regularly adds commands and output fields these docs describe, so an outdated one fails in ways that read like the docs being wrong.
- As of `0.1.0-beta.8` the CLI checks in the background for a newer version and prints an unobtrusive "update available" notice (interactive sessions only; never delays a command). Turn it off with `unity config update-check off` or the `UNITY_NO_UPDATE_CHECK` env var.
- **Under `--format json` and `--format ndjson` that same notice reaches you as a `notifications` array on the envelope** — see [Notifications](#notifications) below. Over MCP it arrives once per session, as prose in the server's `initialize` `instructions`.
- Outbound HTTP from every CLI command honors the resolved proxy (see `unity config proxy`). An invalid `--proxy` value (malformed URL or unsupported scheme) fails with a usage error (exit 2) instead of being silently ignored. Inspect what the CLI actually resolved with `unity env --format json` or `unity doctor --format json` — both surface the active proxy URL, its source, and auth source.
